\begin{abstract}
\noindent The purpose of this document is to announce the availability of a suite of tools, titled ITKTools, to allow users 
to perform command line image processing operations from the command line. ITK is typically though of as library which must be called via a programming language. ITKTools exposes many functionalities of ITK directly to the command line. This allows users to use a ``unix pipe'' style workflow, which is often convenient for experimentation.
